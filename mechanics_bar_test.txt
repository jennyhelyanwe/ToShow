Mechanics Benchmark Problem 1
-----------------------------

The first problem is the deformation of a 1mm x 1mm x 10mm bar.

The undeformed geometry is the region [0,10] x [0,1] x [0,1]

Dirichlet boundary conditions: the left face (x=0) is fixed.

Pressure boundary condition: 0.004 kPa pressure is applied to the bottom (z=0) face.
Please note that the direction of the pressure boundary condition scales with the deformed normal, and its magnitude with deformed area.

Parameters and constitutive law from Guccione et al. 1995 "Finite element stress analysis of left ventricular mechanics in the beating dog heart", i.e.
W = C/2 (e^Q - 1)
Q = b_f E11^2 + b_t (E_22^2 + E33^3 + E23^2+ E32^2) + b_fs (E_12^2 + E_21^2

where
C    = 0.876 kPa
b_f  = 18.48
b_t  = 3.58
b_fs = 1.627

The material is fully incompressible, and both mixed formulations and penalty methods may be used to achieve this.
Note that although the meshes provided may be in a specific format, any type of elements is acceptable.

For now, please report the deformed position of the node at undeformed location (10,1,1), i.e. the point furthest from the origin.


Included in this zip file are results from Slava Gurev:
 geometry.vtk – volume file that contains undeformed geometry for the mesh, all spatial units are in mm
 boundary.vtk – surface file with boundary markers (has the same node numbering as geometry.vtk)
  Pressure of 0.004 kPa was applied to the surface with marker “1”, displacements at the surface with marker “6” was fixed.
 result.vtk – volume file that contains deformed mesh and Right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor components, components are calculated for the centroid of every cell

Note that these meshes are examples for clarification of the problem geometry, and not suggested or required as the mesh used to solve the problem.
